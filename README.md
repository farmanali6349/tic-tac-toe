## 🎯 Project Overview

**Tic Tac Toe** is a classic two-player game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It features a clean and minimal design where two players, **O** and **X**, take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid.

The game checks for winning conditions after every move and displays the result — whether **O wins**, **X wins**, or it’s a **Draw**. A **Reset** button at the bottom allows players to restart the game anytime.

> I initially built the core logic myself and then watched a tutorial from _Apna College_ on YouTube to validate and improve my approach.

## 🧠 How It Works

- The board is a 3x3 grid built with `div` elements.
- A click event is attached to each cell to capture user input.
- JavaScript tracks the player turns (`O` or `X`) and checks for a win or draw after every move.
- Once the game ends, further input is disabled until the user presses **Reset**.
